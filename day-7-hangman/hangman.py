# hangman logic

# upon load have a random word genereated,
# and a string of underscores/blanks that match that words length
# while the blank string does not equal the radmom word prompt the user for a letter
# while lives > 0?
# if it is correct find the index/indices that that letter occurs at in the random word
# replace/splice that letter into the corrseponding index of the blank strinf
# check if all blanks filled, if not go back to beginnng
# if incorrect, add a piecde to teh hang man, and remove that letter from possible options, lose a life, if out of lives game over, if not go back to beginning
# while balnk string does not equal random word.
